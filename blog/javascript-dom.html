    <p><h4>What is Java Script</h4>
    Java Script (JS) is the programming language that makes websites and web applications more dynamic and interactive. 
    The syntax the JS uses is more techinical than html and CSS, to allow for more complex and dynamic functionalities when creating an 
    application and allow for a more pleasant user experience. If HTMl refers to 'skeleton' of the body (i.e application), CSS refers to the
    superficial appreance, the design, that is what you might look like, JS is what allow allows you to add more character and personality
    to your web development. 
  </p>
  <p><h4>Control Flow and Loops</h4>
    When creating web applications, you can use 'Loops' to get your application to repeat certain tasks you want it and get it to stop when you want it too. 
    In JS, you have access to a 'for' loop that can execute this idea.
