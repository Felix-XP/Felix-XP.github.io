    <p><h4>What is Java Script?</h4>
    Java Script (JS) is the programming language that makes websites and web applications more dynamic and interactive. 
    The syntax the JS uses is more techinical than html and CSS, to allow for more complex and dynamic functionalities when creating an 
    application and allow for a more pleasant user experience. If HTMl refers to 'skeleton' of the body (i.e application), CSS refers to the
    superficial appreance, the design, that is what you might look like, JS is what allow allows you to add more character and personality
    to your web development. 
  </p>
  <p><h4>Control Flow and Loops</h4>
    When creating web applications, you can use 'Loops' to get your application to repeat certain tasks you want it to and get it to stop when you want it too. 
    In JS, you have access to a 'for' loop that can execute this idea. 
    <p><img src="/../images/forloop.png"></p>
    <p>above we can see the js code syntax for a 'for' loop. In the (brackets) we can see that the 'for' loop is devided into three parts. Where 'i=0' we have the 'Intialisation' part; Then next we have the 'conditional'part where 'i < x'; And finally the 'Incrementation' part 
    with 'i++' meaning, go through the loop again - until the condition is no longer true (i.e. if i becomes greater than the value of x stop the loop).The curly brackets {} is the space where you can include more code that can be executed 
  for every interation of the loop.</p>

  <p>In the above flow diagram we can get a better understanding of the Control Flow of  'for' loops. </p>
  <p><h4>The Document Object Model (DOM)</h4></p>
  <p><img id="homeImg" src="https://howtoprogramwithjava.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the_document_object_model.gif"></p>
  <p>The DOM exist in a more abstract sense. Looking at the image above, It is commonly expressed as a 'family tree' of objects. Each object that exists is sourced or exist within a 'parent'
    object. For html, every object is linked or exists entirely within the html root element/object. The html object itself exist within the 'document' object.<br>
   The DOM allows you to access each specific object that exist inside the document object. Using JS, these objects can be manipulated and changed to whatever liking.</p>
   <p><h4>Arrays and Objects</h4>
  Arrays refer to where data is stored in memory. Objects refer to the inner substrate elements, which are themselves objects, that make an object; referring to previous content, substrate html objects that make the root object/element, that collectively make the document object.<br>
  Genreally, arrays in JS are identified using square brakets[] and using these square brackets you can access the data, whilst objects can be accessed by its name tag.
