  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <p>
    There's this old challenge called the 'Fizzbuzz' challenege, interviewers use to give, to guage the level of a persons programming. 
    At this point I haven't yet got a good understanding of the language semantics and syntax so this challenge was extremely daunting to me.
    I reall didnt know where to start. This greatly anoyed me. I also really wanted to try and figure it out on my own where no help, unsing 
    my own mind, like my facilitator I always watch in the workshop vids. Anyways nothing was coming up. I was getting quite stressed out and 
    frustrated; usually when I get like this I know to leave my desk, go for a little walk around, and just kinda clear and refresh my mind, 
    before coming back to trying to tackel the problem. This process can take like 10 minutes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time I came back I tried using pseudo coding and "the Rubber ducky" methods to intiate at least the thought processes for trying to
    solve this problem - The Fizzbuzz Challenge. It was good, it did intitate the process. After writing down a good plan (pseudo code) I 
    did a bit of brainstorming trying to figure out the relevelant information of everything I've learned so far. My plan and my thought process
    got more detailed and the problem became more clearer in my head. This got me more confident as well. Long story short with a bit of youtubing
    and revision, I run some ideas that didnt work but eventually worked out a good solution.

  <p><h4>Problem Solving Techniques</h4>
    Below are a list of problem solving techniques and how I fell utilising them:
    <ul>
      <li>I like using <b>Pseudocode</b> because I'm still quite old fashioned with my pen and paper. It also good because I can interpret the steps 
          or ideas I need, quite well because I'm using my own language. Its a good intiate process for probelm solving.</li>
      <li>At this point I don't like the technique of <b>Trying something</b>. I do use it though, its just everything I try, doesnt work.</li>
      <li>The <b>Rubber Ducky method</b> is a funny one for me cause halfway through I realise im talking to an inanimate object, then I start 
          I start talking to myself, then it gets weird.</li>
      <li>I like <b>reading error messages</b> cause they provide a lot of useful information</li>
      <li>I use <b>console logging</b> quite a bit to see if my code runs and gives me the output I expect.</li>
      <li>Not a big fan of <b>googling</b>. Sometimes there is just too much information I am reading through and find it hard to disern what is useful.</li>
      <li>Asking people for help is not a strong suit of mine let alone <b>asking my peers for help</b>.</li>
      <li>I'm algoods <b>asking my facilitator for help</b> because they are quite smart and I know they are always willing to help.</li>
      <li>I'm big on using <b>reflection</b> as a porblem solving technique. It helps me pinpoint where I went wrong and think of alternative solutions for that 
          past scenario. Those alternative solutions have a high possiblity of being soltuions for future problems.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I think the problem I have with 'asking for help' might be linked to two things. One, that I've lived a life uptill now that has required me to solely
    rely on myself and this old habit as made its way into my core beliefs and Two; past traumas from the times I did ask for help and it ended up backfiring. 
    At this point in my life I am coming to realise the importance of family, companionship and friendship more deeply. With a little bit of courage,
    utilising on the people around can greatly serve you in your life. So for me, I need more courage, and this is something that can come from practicing
    the art of 'reaching out'.
