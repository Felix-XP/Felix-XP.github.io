Whilst IQ is important to realise mechanical structure of a persons intelligence, EQ encompasses the more abstracts
dimensions of human existience. understanding that we are not only just flesh and bones, EQ realises

ones intelligence. However IQ should not be disregarded in the discussion of ones 'intelligence.'
