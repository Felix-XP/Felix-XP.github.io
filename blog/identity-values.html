    <h1>Identity and Values</h1>
    <p>
      I Identify myself by the means, principles and teachings of the
      Judeo-Christian canon and values and by the authority of the Holy Catholic Church.
      Essentially, <b>Jesus Christ is my Lord and God</b>. It is in him, I find
      my Identity.

    <p><h4>Hard Times</h4>
    In this section im asked to write about a a situation where I had to make a difficult ethical decision. The one that comes to mind
  is this one time I was working in town and I was getting verbally abused for my faith. It was really bothering me cause they were swearing and 
saying some pretty disrespectful stuff about My God, JC. There was a massive urge to punch the guy in the face but he wasn't physically violent
so i knew I had to check my self. So I just took the abuse. He even spat at me. It wasn't even my fault, he was abusing another customer and 
I told him to stop. Looking back I knew it was the right thing to do, even tho it was hard. To not do anything to escalate the situation, just take 
the abuse, if its just words, until they eventually Leave.</p>
    <p><h4>Faith Family and Friends</h4>
    I am Samoan but a kiwi born and bred. That makes me a 2nd generation Samoan, cause my Parents was born and raise in samoa.
    As well as being Samoan, my family is also pretty hearty catholics. Things were pretty strict growing up, but these days, I have
  come to discover my own meaning to what being samoan and being a catholic looks like in my life. These two communities, that is essentially my 
family and my faith community are the most inmportant to me. All my close friends are catholic as well. In a more general perspective, 
I welcome everyone to my life. God works in mysterirous ways and we are taught that everyone is a child of God and must be treated as such. I dont know 
about the entire world, but there is definately room to give love to my wider samoan and faith communties and the spaces wheather my God calls
me too. At the same time even in my church and family, you know theres people you dont like, but that's just part of the journeyI guess. So yeah
my Family, Friends and Faith are the most important things in my life right now. It is for them and the love they have given me over the years,
that i do the things that I do to better my self.</p>
<p><h4>Strengths and Limitations</h4> 
  The main strengths I think I'll mention in this section is the discipline, hardwork and honesty. I mention these 
  cause I think they'll be the ones that matter most in this study season of mine. Im generally pretty self motivated to do
  the things I need to do that forwards towards a goal.The main strengths I think I'll mention in this section is the discipline, hardwork and honesty. I mention these

<p>My Limitations include, again relating to this study season, would be time orientation and actual knowledge of the feild.
  I live a pretty busy life right now, but I am in the process of re-arranging my priorities, cutting of things where need be, 
  to allow myself the best possible position for studying. Trying suss this out proper before bootcamp.
  Im struggling to make deadlines right now, finding myself doin work right upto the due time, planning on rectifying this so that
  it doesnt happen.</p>

  <p><h3>another hard situation</h3>
    There was this one time I was running a team at work. Two of my co-workers, who were also good work mates, were fighting and 
    there was a high chance it was going to get violent. It was affecting the rest of the team and general work flow, so I had to sit them down.
    Now given the context of what they were fighting about (it was personal), it wasn't gona work to just sit them down and instruct 
    them to get along. By this point they were highly emotional. So I got in contact with another time and transffered one, then arranged for a meeting 
    after work, in hopes of mediation. Long story short, we had a good discussion to which at least they were able to work together and I would
    monitor their behaviours during work. The deeper work around forgiveness and healing I knew was none of my business really and had to 
    be something that had to venture into individually and together.
