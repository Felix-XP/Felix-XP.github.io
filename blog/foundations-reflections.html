    <h2>Foundations Reflections</h2>
    
    <p>
      <h4>Three things I learned about Myself and My Ego</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I learned that I can be pretty impatient when it comes to learning new
            things and the willingness to master it straight of the cuff.
          </li>
          <li>
            I learned that when I get stressed out, I max out on procrastination.
          </li>
          <li>
            I learned that im not necessarily kind to myself in self talk.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h4>Values, Empathy and Self Awareness in learning and programming</h4>
      
        <p> I believe that values are important in remaining true to who you are in 
            whatever the context you find youself; whether in learning or in work environment.
            I believe that it through your values, you are able to create your character; the
            picture of yourself you want to present the world.
        </p>
        <p> I believe empathy is important mostly for in regards to listening to others and 
            journeying along side people. This can be for your learning and work spaces. I 
            believe you should hold empathy for yourself especially in the times of stress and 
            when programming becomes quite difficult; empathy allows you to hold space for youself
            where you should be kind give youself grace. 
        </p>
        <p> Self Awareness I believe is a powerful tool for your mental, spiritual and learning development. 
            A tool to help recognise and manage emotions and internal processes to optimise 
            overall performance. 
        </p>
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>Core Learning(s)</h4>
      
        <p> I was quite surprised about the core learnings over the last 5 weeks. Just a broad
            perspective, I thought it was qutie special that dev academy had a large portion of its 
            foundations cirriculem based around recognising importance of being a human. 
        </p>
        <p> One particular experience I had during foundations was Imposter syndrome. It was 
            challenge to continue to believe that one day I can be a great programmer, seeing that 
            right now, looking at my skill set, I suck shit. 
        </p>
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>The Importance of Core Skills</h4>
        <p> In dev academy core cirriculem, it was commonly mentioned that one of the most important attributes for successful employabilty, is the level of 
            a persons core competence. I believe this to be true as well. The importance of establishing a character that is mindful and considerate of 
            his/hers surroundings is a desirable quality to have in any workplace.</p>
        <p> I believe the 'Core Cirriculem' has its rightful place in dev academy. I believe core skills are skills that have an endless potential
            for development. Being a programmer is a sub attribute of being human. It is most likely that more important role, we can adopt will manifest 
            in our future lives, then that of being a programmer. Understanding these things you can realise core skills to be the fundemental of 
            all skills. Improvement in this area will silmultanousley improve all other skills. Whilst mastery of arguabley the greatest creation of
            human ingenuity is an acheivement worth its praise, if you're a dick, well no ones really gona care.
