    <h1>The difference between Margins, Borders and Padding</h1>
    <p>
      The most common computer programming language that is used for the
      development and creation of websites and web applications is, HTML. This
      stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Websites display and are created using a combination of elements i.e
      headings, images, text/paragraphs etc
    </p>
    <p>
      These elements are identified using HTML opening and closing tags e.g.
      (looking below) the paragraph tags with the paragraph text (content)
      inside the tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following shows an image of a websites HTML code and the corresponding
      browser output displayed:
      <br />
      <img
        style="width: 500px, height 350px"
        src="https://espirian.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/code_sample.png"
        alt="HTML to browser"
      />
      <br />
      The text in orange are the HTML tags that identify the element. Within
      those tags you can add whatever content. Some tags/elements require
      specific content of that type i.e. an img tag/element will only output
      images.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margins Borders and Padding are examples of elements. looking at the image
      below, Marigns, borders and padding refer to the spacing around
      elements/content.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/G0b9IA2IYa9HEpCHMiUE1K0GBoM=/1532x1179/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Padding-5ada00eb1d640400390ccf6d.jpg"
        alt="Margins border padding"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see the 'space' around elements is divided into three
      groups/layers. The inital layer/space around the content is the
      <b>Padding</b>. The next layer, that refers to the space around the
      padding, is the <b>Border</b>. Followed by outer most layer of space
      around an element which is the <b>Margin</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margins, Borders and Paddings can be manipulated and changed to whatever
      liking, using CSS.
