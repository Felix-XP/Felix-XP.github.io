    <h1>The difference between Margins, Borders and Padding</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Websites and web applications are created using a combination of HTML, CSS and JS codes(languages).</li>
        <li>You can think of HTML as the strutural foundation of websites, responsible for holding everything together.</li>
        <li>CSS and JS are responsible for the websites aestitics and dynamics.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When displayed is a code editior, we can see that, websites contain and are functional using a range of different <i>elements</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These elements are identified using HTML opening and closing tags e.g.
      (looking below), the 'p' tags indicates to the browser that the follwing content is a 'paragraph'
    </p>
    <p>
      The following shows an image of a websites HTML code, in a code editor, and the corresponding
      browser output displayed:
      <br />
      <img id="homeImg"
        style="width: 500px, height 350px"
        src="https://espirian.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/code_sample.png"
        alt="HTML to browser"
      />
        <br />
        The text in orange are the HTML tags that identify the element. Within
        those tags you can add whatever content. Some tags/elements require
        specific content of that type i.e. an img tag/element will only output
        images.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, elements can be given characteristics by manipulating the elements <b>attributes</b>.</p>
    <p>
      Margins Borders and Padding are examples of an elements attributes. looking at the image
      below, Marigns, borders and padding refer to the spacing around
      elements/content.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img id="homeImg"
        src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/G0b9IA2IYa9HEpCHMiUE1K0GBoM=/1532x1179/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Padding-5ada00eb1d640400390ccf6d.jpg"
        alt="Margins border padding"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see the 'space' around elements is divided into three
      groups/layers. The inital layer/space around the content is the
      <b>Padding</b>. The next layer, that refers to the space around the
      padding, is the <b>Border</b>. Followed by outer most layer of space
      around an element which is the <b>Margin</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margins, Borders and Paddings can be manipulated and changed to whatever
      liking, using CSS and JS.
