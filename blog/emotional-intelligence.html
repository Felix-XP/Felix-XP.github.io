    EQ also refers to the skills, processes and systems you might have in managing your emotions and the skills, processes
    and systems you might have for delaing with other peoples emotions.</p> 
    
  <p><h4>how does EQ differ from IQ?</h4>
    while EQ measures the emotional state of a person, IQ (intelligence quotient) measures the cognitive abilities, problem solving skills and 
    and logical thinking of a person.</p>
    
  <p><h4>why is EQ important?</h4>
    Whilst IQ is important to realise mechanical structure of a persons intelligence, EQ encompasses the more abstracts
    dimensions of human existience. understanding that we are not only just flesh and bones, EQ realises
    that the emotional well-being of a person, no matter the context, trumps the conventions of IQ, in the measure of
    ones intelligence. However IQ should not be disregarded in the discussion of ones 'intelligence.'</p>
