    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Wha</h1>
    <p><h2>My Well-Being Plan</h2>I consider myself to be pretty goal orientated and mindful about my general wellbeing. 
       I structure my routine by tasks associated to my goals, within the catagories of My Physical, Mental and Spiritual. It was a refreshing 
       experience for me learning about Ta Mason Durie's well-being model of Te Whare Tapa Wha. I think that its special that the specific ideas and concepts 
       are drawn from and linked too Maori symbols and concepts. Maori spirituality is special to me, being of samoan decent, where our cultures 
       share alot of similarities and also for me as someone that claims Aotearoa as their home, I believe its appropriate to honour the Tangata Whenua, 
       who share their land with us. Learning about Te Whare Tapa Wha and intergrating it into my Learning Plan, in some small sense 
       allows me the opportunity to honour as such. </p>
    <p><h4>Taha Tinana</h4>
    I currently do crossfit and I have the general goal of getting absolutely shredded. Currently the plan has been 
    to go class(crossfit), minimum 5x a week. However once the bootcamp starts, I will be attending the 6am classes. Im not 
    a morning person, so trying to build the routine now. For my diet I am doing the carnivore diet. 
    This all links as well to this 8 week challenge I am doing at my gym where the goal is to loose as much body fat as possible and the winner 
    gets heaps of money. </p>
    <p><h4>Taha Whanau</h4>
    My family/Village is really important to me. So making time for them has it priorities in my life and my routines. 
    Most of the reasons as to why I live my life the way I do is because of my family. So in that regard, because we're all other now and 
    living our lives, I try and make time to go over and see my siblings whenever I can. Also We're intentional about a family event once every fortnight 
    or once every month. I can try for more but happy with what I have.</p>
    <p><h4>Taha Hinengaro</h4>Emotional and Mental wellbeing can be quite the task to get healthy. I use to suffer from alot of anxiety and depression 
    in my early adult life. Talking to loved ones is a good one for me to maintain well being in this area. otherwise I've picked up the skill 
    of journalling whichs has been good in helping me articulate my internal processes. I feel like I should be journalling more so maybe I can plan 
    to Journal a min once a week.</p>
    <p><h4>Taha Wairua</h4>My faith is important to me as a Catholic. There are certain minimum requirements being a catholic has, that is to serve
     you in your spiritual life and spiritual well being and foster growth. Going to Mass every sundays is important to me. Otherwise I am Intentional about making space for 
     daily prayers.</p>
    <p><h4>Whenua</h4>
    I consider myself an outdoors guy and have a natural affinity to nature. Samoans has the same understanding about the importance of and looking after it. 
    I Like immersive experiences and like going for hikes. These days cause im busy, I try get out and walk my dog. I live 5mins away from the waitakere ranges, and going 
    there gives me the sense of the idea discussed in whenua. I havent been there in a while, so I could plan to go there soon.</p>
