        <p><h4>What is Neuroplasticity?</h4>
  Neuroplasticity refers to the physiological aspects of the brain, as an organ, 
  and the chemical processes that takes place. Neuroplasticity compares the physical properties of the brain to 
  that of 'plastic'. Neuroplasticity suggest that the brain  
 physiological attributes can be altered over time.<br>
 Neuroplasiticty is an idea drawn from the feild of nueroscience. Neuroscience is the biological/physical representation of 
 thoughts and emotions. 
 Neuroplasiticty discusses the cellular interactivity of neurons, the creation and deterioration processes of nueropathways 
 and how you can manipulate these chemical processes using your thoughts and/or mental exercises.<br> 
This is a particularly good 'concept' for people to know. Alot of studies as have claimed that simply knowing that you can 
change your brain structure, in itself, increases neuroplasticity and brain functionality. It can be quite the motivating factor for people to 
understand that your thoughts and ideas are not 
fixed. Neuroplasity essentially follows the 'use it or loose it' rule in any attempts to optimise on nueroplasticity. Initiating 
increased practice and
focus on a particular habit, idea or task, given enough time, will reallocate brain function to support your focusses and that once difficult task you had, 
 becomes so much easier. This 
process is essentially Neuroplasticity in action.</p>
       <p><h4>Growth Mindet</h4>
Growth mindset refers to the behaviours and attitudes you can adopt in your general appraoch to learning and life. Having a 
growth mindset means to silmultaneously acknowledge your limits, but also more importantly, <b>your potential</b> for development.
This means that a more acurate assessment of your capabilites should include not just your current acheivement level, but also 
acheivement possibilities. Without scale(the consideration of time), 'growth mindset' suggest an endless 
learning and acheivement possibility. The determining factor of your success, in whatever context, would be repetition (practice).<br>
Whilst the idea of 'growth mindest' exist in a more abstract sense, along with the idea of neuroplasiticity, we can recognise a more fuller
and deeper understanding of this idea, how we can use it for our benefit.</p>
