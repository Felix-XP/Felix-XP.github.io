    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <p>
      My initial goal right now, as I studywith dev academy, is to learn and
      build a computer programming skill that can help me create whatever I
      want. As for my carrer pathway, I feel like I don't know enough about
      programming and the industry to forsee myself in a particular role or
      working for a particular company. I do know that part of who I am, that' s
      my my culture and how I have been raised, has always felt the most
      authentic in spaces of service. I look at my Family, Samoan and Pacific
      and Church communties and there's is no-one I know that has done computer
      programming. I also think this industry is novice to my people. I plan to
      master this skill and bring it back to share with my communities. I think this is
      normal for everyone; I also want to put myself in the space to be able to
      help my loved ones out, the best way I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>My Strengths and Limitations</h4>
      <P>The main strengths I think I'll mention in this section is the discipline, hardwork and honesty. I mention these 
        cause I think they'll be the ones that matter most in this study season of mine. Im generally pretty self motivated to do
        the things I need to do that forwards towards a goal.</P>
      <p>My Limitations include, again relating to this study season, would be time orientation and actual knowledge of the feild.
        I live a pretty busy life right now, but I am in the process of re-arranging my priorities, cutting of things where need be, 
        to allow myself the best possible position for studying. Trying suss this out proper before bootcamp.
        Im struggling to make deadlines right now, finding myself doin work right upto the due time, planning on rectifying this so that
        it doesnt happen. 
      </p>  
    </p>
    <p><h4>What skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
    I want to build my social skills, around working and getting along with people from all walks of life. 
    I think this is an essential skill for big dreamers like my self, to have. 
    I'm use to being around people from similar backgrounds as me, so most of the time its easy to get along with them.
    Travelling the world, I've realised how many wonderful people are out there doing amazing things. Besides the languaging barriers, 
    I think it'll be useful to build a skill that will support more of these experiences. 
    </p>
    <p><h4>My Commitments</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I am committed to my studies and will manage my workload to the best of my abilities.</li>
        <Li>I will treat others with the utmost dignity and respect they are innately entitled too.</Li>
    </p>
    <p>I am commited to Academic Integrity. This includes prioritising my acdemic studies as top priority for 
      the next 15 weeks. Integrity also includes for me, asking for help when need be and being grateful for how the help is being given.
      It also includes solid communication with my facilitators, whenever I am in a difficult position and my academic plans are in jeprody.  
    </p>
    <p><h4>My Expectations</h4>
      Not saying they aren't doing this at all, but my expectations of the facilitators facilitating me in my learning journey is to be kind and gentle.
      Although I am prepared to look the fool, Learning programming is really new to me. I wouldn't even say prior to this I was tech savy at all. 
      Otherwise I am someone that appreciates and functions better when things are more direct and straight to the point. I'm honest about 
      my difficulties and inadequacey with programming and computer science so I expect that to be respected. But being honest about my inadequacy allows me for a more
      fuller and successful learning experience. 
    </p>
    <p><h4>Notes</h4>
      I have established a routine based on the goal of; completion of studies to the best of my abilities.
      my routine takes into consideration my mental, spiritual and physical wellbeing so as to put myself in the best possible position to Learn
      and reduce risk of burnout.
      Most of all this work is done in the mornings from 6am-830am otherwise when if i really need it I make space in the eveinings. 
      The weekends are really important to me for spaces such as my family and Church. I make it a point not to do
      'work' during the weekend but will do so for studying if need be. My plan goin forward is to try keep all my studying from monday to friday.
      I use the weekends as a time to rest and recover, but studying now, I've realised that there is no time for it. But its okay rn, moving forward 
      I hafto stay aware with my emotional state and communicate when things are becoming increasingly difficult.
